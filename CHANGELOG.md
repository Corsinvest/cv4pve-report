## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-07

### What's new

- **Syslog** — new global sheet with syslog from all nodes combined in one place
- **Cluster Log** — cluster-wide event log (replaces "Audit Log")
- **Cluster Tasks** — new sheet with all cluster-level tasks
- **Firewall** — new global sheet with rules, aliases and IP sets across cluster, nodes, VMs and CTs
- **Replication** — new global sheet with all replication jobs and status
- **RRD Guests** — new global performance metrics sheet for VMs and CTs (disabled by default)
- **Storage Content / Backups** — storage files and backups moved to dedicated global sheets
- **Back links** — every node, VM and CT detail sheet now has a `← Back` link to its list
- **More hyperlinks** — RRD, Replication, Firewall, Storage Content and Backups sheets now have clickable node, VM and storage links

### Changes

- RRD data removed from individual VM/CT detail sheets — now in the global RRD Guests sheet
- Each section (Node, Storage, Guest) has its own parallel request limit for RRD data
- Settings reorganized: storage content options grouped under `Storage.Content`
- `Guest.RrdData` disabled by default — can produce very large sheets on big clusters

### Fixes

- Fixed a crash when generating the report with many sheets
- Fixed wrong column headers in Storage Content / Backups sheets in certain configurations
- Fixed empty rows in the Firewall sheet when a node or VM had no rules

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-03

### What's new

- **Network sheet** — new dedicated sheet with a complete network inventory across the entire cluster: all node interfaces and all VM/CT network cards with MAC address, bridge, VLAN, IP addresses and OS info in one place
- **Disks sheet** — new dedicated sheet with VM/CT disk inventory: storage, size, cache, backup flag, unused flag, mount point, passthrough
- **VM IP addresses** — IP addresses from the QEMU agent are now visible directly in the VM overview and network tables
- **VM overview** — new columns: Networks (MAC + bridge/VLAN), IP Addresses, Hostname
- **VM network detail** — additional fields: Trunks, Disconnect, LinkDown, Gateway, Gateway6
- **VM disk detail** — additional fields: MountPoint, MountSourcePath, Passthrough
- **Node network detail** — full IPv6 fields now included: Cidr6, Address6, Netmask6, Gateway6, Method6
- **Node disks** — reorganized settings: `SettingsDisk` class with `Enabled`, `IncludeSmartData`, `IncludeZfs`, `IncludeDirectory`
- **Node detail** — new optional tables: Directory mount points, ZFS pools with vdev tree
- **APT Repositories** — new `IncludeAptRepositories` option to show configured APT repositories in node detail
- **Cluster Audit Log** — cluster event log can now be included in the Cluster sheet with `OnlyErrors` and `MaxCount` filters
- **SkipEmptyCollections** — new global setting to skip empty collections (e.g., no snapshots) from the report
- **README** — added "Where cv4pve-report fits" section with RVTools comparison table

### Changes

- Version bumped to 1.2.0
- Settings reorganization: disk-related settings moved from `SettingsNode` to dedicated `SettingsDisk` class
- Audit Log settings enhanced with `OnlyErrors` filter for severity-based filtering

### Fixes

- HA Groups correctly skipped on PVE 9 and later where the API endpoint was removed

- **SDN Ipams and Subnets** — SDN section now also covers IP address management and subnets per vnet
- **Syslog** — each node detail sheet can now include the system log (disabled by default, enabled in Full profile)
- **Firewall logs** — node and VM/CT firewall logs now support date range and line count filters
- **Task filters** — tasks on nodes and VMs/CTs can now be filtered by errors only, limited by count, and filtered by source (node only, all, active)
- **Full profile** — now includes syslog and firewall logs limited to the last 7 days (1000 lines max)
